# AmazonPrimeDayReaction_Twitter

16th July 2018 was Amazon's Prime Day.
Since user faced a lot of trouble because of server issues. I was curious to know how people reacted to this big day.

I extracted 2000 tweets to perform sentiment analysis using R.
Results were quite interesting.
It seems like the deals were too fantastic to win people's heart.

Amazon, you did it again!
No wonder Amazon is ruling e-commerce business.
