# AmazonPrimeDayReaction_Twitter

16th July 2018 was Amazon's Prime Day.
Since user faced a lot of trouble because of server issues. I was curious to know how people reacted to this big day.

I extracted 2000 tweets to perform sentiment analysis using R. Results were quite interesting. It seems like Amazon handled it pretty well. Putting up dogs picture on an error page might have helped a bit. Anyways, who don't like dogs, except Chandler Bing maybe (just a FRIENDs thing). 


Amazon, you did it again!
No wonder Amazon is ruling e-commerce business.
